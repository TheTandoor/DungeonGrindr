DungeonGrinder is a temporary solution to a terrible problem. Blizzard is refusing to give us an RDF for wotlk classic so we are instead left to improving the DungeonFinderUI ourselves. DungeonGrindr aims to remove the tedious manual group creation with a slightly less tedious automatic(ish) group creation that also allows blacklisting of some useless roles.
