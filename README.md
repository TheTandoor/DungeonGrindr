# DungeonGrindr

DungeonGrinder is a temporary solution to a terrible problem. Blizzard is refusing to give us an RDF for wotlk classic so we are instead left to improving the DungeonFinderUI ourselves. DungeonGrindr aims to remove the tedious manual group creation with a slightly less tedious automatic(ish) group creation that also allows blacklisting of some useless roles.


## How to use
```
1. Select your role in the top left corner
2. Select your desired dungeon in the drop down
3. Select Queue
4. Tap refresh as often as you would like to fill the queue.
  a. Alternatively add /click DungeonGrindrRefresh to a macro and spam that macro (I macro this into dps abilities)
  b. Closing the DungeonGrindr frame doesn't remove you from queue and when your group is ready it will reopen automatically if using step a.
5. Press the Invite To Group button when the queue pops
```
## Commands
```
/dg
/dg show
/dg hide
```

## Why is there an 'exclude warrior dps` checkbox?
Because they are suboptimal and the user should have the choice of which classes/roles they want to dungeon with. 

The main reason is that the community actively avoids specifics classes and this is meant to highlight the pains that are created for some players when RDF isn't added.
Blizzard could easily create RDF and remove the dungeon teleport and xrealm functionality but they are choosing to ignore their own community pillar.
